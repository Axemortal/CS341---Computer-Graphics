# Solution Description

**Task 2.1**: Retrieved the gradients of the nearest point and interpolated them to determine the value at the given point.  

**Task 3.1**: Summed the noise effects as specified.  

**Task 4.1**: Implemented 2D Perlin noise, closely following the 1D implementation.  

**Task 5.1**: Applied the given formulas to procedurally generate terrain textures using fractal brownian motion (fBm).  

**Task 6.1**: Converted integer coordinates into 2D points within the defined range and used elevation values to determine terrain colors.
