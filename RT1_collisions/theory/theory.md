## Ray-Cylinder Intersection

![A cylinder with axis $\mathbf{a}$, center $\mathbf{c}$, radius $r$, and height $h$](images/cyl_diagram.png){width="300px"}

This is an inline LaTeX formula: $a t^2 + b t + c = 0$. You can use inline formulas to write mathematical expressions in the text.

If you want to write a formula in a separate line, you can use the following syntax:

$$
\begin{equation}
a t^2 + b t + c = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

Please replace these lines with your solution.
